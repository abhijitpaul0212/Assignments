    "1. It is a high-level, general-purpose programming language\n",
    "2. It is used for: web development (server-side), software development, mathematics, data science, system scripting.\n",
    "3. It's design philosophy is to enhance code-readability with the use of indentation\n",
    "4. It is dynamically typed & auto garbage-collected language\n",
    "5. It works on diferent operating system\n",
    "6. It runs on an interpreter system, which means each line of code can be executed as soon as its written, i.e. supports quick prototyping\n",

    "4. On installation of a package it resides in the system and only when we import it, it gets loaded in RAM to avoid wastage of RAM.\n",
